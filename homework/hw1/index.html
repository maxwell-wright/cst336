                    <p id="indexInfo">A computer virus is a program that is designed with the purpose
                    of invading vulnerable systems and gain access to private data. The first known
                    computer virus was developed in 1971 by Robert Thomas, an engineer at BBN Technologies. 
                    The virus's name was the <em>Creeper</em>
                    and the term computer virus wasn't coined until 1983 with Fred
                    Cohen's paper, "Computer Viruses - Theory and Experiments".</p>
